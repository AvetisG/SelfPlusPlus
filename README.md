# SelfPlusPlus

A thought-provoking web application for challenging your future self to be better than the one thinking about it in the present time.

The name plus plus (++) comes from a concept in programming known as post increment which simply increments the value put behind it. For example 7++ would become 8. So as a joke we put ourselves out there and increment it through this web application to go to our future self - hence the plus plus.

For all the technical people who are asking why not pre increment (where we put ++ in the beginning) instead of post increment my answer is simply this - it sounds better :)

Enjoy it and I hope it helps you get to your better self!

This application has taken inspiration from https://www.futureme.org/ which helped me in my own journey, however I wanted to have my own in case I needed to add more features instead of relying on another tool to do it for me.
